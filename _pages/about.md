### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ I'm currently finishing PhD at Skoltech and I research computer vision in medical imaging. Check me out [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kondratevakate/) profile for more. I also have medical background, and finished radiology courses and have experience in deploing ML models. 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about *brain MRI data*

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on projects involving **domain adaptation** for medical imaging and **interpratable models**. Check out my [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/eess?searchtype=author&query=Kondrateva%2C+E) for our lastest work on medical segmentation and MRI data preprocessing.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email is fine, for quick reply write in telegram @katushka2ushka
